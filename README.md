# Findus Web App
[![.NET](https://github.com/CompassMotionAB/Findus-WebApp/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CompassMotionAB/Findus-WebApp/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

This Web Application was developed with highly specific internal use cases. This repository does not contain any proprietary information but should only be used as a collection of disparate code snippets of how you might implement a third party OAuth2 API with MVC .net application.

This repository is in active development and only a handful of functions in FindusController and all of LoginController is in active use.
